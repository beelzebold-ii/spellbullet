# Spellbullet
Hello! I am niko. if you are not niko then this repo has nothing for you. This project exists only very nebulously split across a love2d project and two raylib projects.

Spellbullet [ is/was/will be ] a spellweaving and gunning topdown shooter roguelike/lite involving various guns, various magical spells, and demonic and/or humanoid enemies.
## 

I am making this repo because I was struck with inspiration to make the source of the player's powers be some kind of unknown pseudo-deific being with some form of emotional attachment to the player.

(think shadow-spawn from beyond the stars girlfriend)
## 

I would like to recover the original files for the love2d version, but I don't currently have an easy way to read my ssd, nor do I know if it even still works.

Instead I will likely begin from scratch in c sharp with raylib.

(I have been wanting to use c sharp for a while as I have plenty of experience with zscript which alledgedly shares both a lot of syntax and features with c sharp. I'll still miss how adorable lua is she's my bby 4ever <3)
